    "This week, we will work through Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 of Toms. Both chapters focus on map scripting using arcpy.mapping. Please feel free to take a break between finishing Chapter 8 and starting Chapter 9.  It is my hope that both chapters can be completed during class. IF you are unable to finish during class, please work through the chapters on your own time."
