# Programming for Remote Sensing and GIS (GIS 4090\5090)

## Course Description
This course will introduce students to Python programming and its applications to remote sensing and GIS. Through completing this course, students will be able to use Python to perform common GIS and remote sensing analysis tasks, automate workflows, and develop custom Python tools. Topics will include describing data, manipulating data, automating spatial analysis tasks, creating Python scripts and tools, and using Python for imagery analysis. This course will also introduce students to Github, Jupyter, and Markdown.

## Course Objectives
- Learn Python and understand how to use it to solve problems in GIS and Remote Sensing
- Encourage the use of Python through relevant examples and assignments
- Get graduate level students implementing it in their own research projects.
